## 💡 Design Highlights

* **Highlight Effects**: Used image-based highlights (pink, yellow, blue) to draw attention to key text.
* **Rotations & Shadows**: Elements like sticky notes and experience cards use CSS `transform` to give a dynamic feel.
* **Minimalist Theme**: Clean white background with bold colors for hierarchy and contrast.
* **Custom Fonts**: Handlee and Inter give a unique personality to headings and text.

---

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

* On smaller screens:

  * Fonts scale down for readability.
  * Gaps and spacing are adjusted.
  * Layouts wrap or stack for better alignment.
  * Decorative borders are hidden for cleaner mobile views.
